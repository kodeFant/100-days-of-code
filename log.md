# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: October 1st, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Fixed some CSS on kodeFant.no (Norwegian)/ DrifterCode.com (English), my bilingual Blog about web sites, communications and programming. I will from now on only call it DrifterCode since that is the English version.

DrifterCode is made with the Full Roots Stack including a Trellis server, the Bedrock boilerplate and the Sage 9 starter them with modern developer workflow like Webpack and Laravel Blade templating. Both the Norwegian and English site is managed through the same WordPress install.

**Thoughts:** I initially made my Trellis install on a Mac several weeks ago, but wanted to continue developing it on my Ubuntu Linux machine. I pulled the code through the git repository and had some issues with some error messages about SSH and NFS. I managed to fix it, but it took a couple of hours.

Battling configurations errors can really test the patience of a guy just wanting to code. Still, all these tools are very powerful, open source and free, so I am very thankful. But when I google for fixes, I often end up on tutorials with lots of terminal commands. And some errors were because I configured my Linux installation with encryption on **/home**.

It sometimes feels like the need for all these guides are bugs when the documentation does not cover it really are bugs. Or it might just be that all the flexibility of these powerful tools add some necessary complexity.

**Plans for tomorrow:** I want to start building a conceptual restaurant app. I think I will try building it with WordPress REST API and React on the Front End.
