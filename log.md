# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: October 1st, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Fixed some CSS on DrifterCode.com/kodefant.no, my bilingual Blog about web sites, communications and programming. I will from now on only call it DrifterCode since that is the English version. Both the Norwegian and English site is managed through the same WordPress install through the [WPML Plugin](https://wpml.org/).

DrifterCode is made with the Full [Roots Stack](https://roots.io/) including a Trellis server, the Bedrock boilerplate and the Sage 9 starter them with modern developer workflow like Webpack and Laravel Blade templating.

**Thoughts:** I initially made my Trellis install on a Mac several weeks ago, but wanted to continue developing it on my Ubuntu Linux machine. I pulled the code through the git repository and had some issues with some error messages about SSH and NFS. I managed to fix it, but it took a couple of hours to work out.

Battling configurations errors can test the patience of a guy just wanting to code. Still, all these tools are very powerful, open source and free, so I am very thankful. But when I google for fixes, I often end up on tutorials with lots of terminal commands. And some errors were because I configured my Linux installation with encryption on **/home**.

It sometimes feels like the need for all these guides signifies a bug that no one will claim. I think this applies to how the different technologies interact, so these things are probably not easy to solve for the developers. This must be challenging when working with DevOps, but I guess the DevOps engineers learn to live with these challenges.

Just to be clear, these tools are actually amazing, free and open source.

**Plans for tomorrow:** I want to start building a conceptual restaurant app. I think I will try building it with WordPress REST API and React on the Front End.
