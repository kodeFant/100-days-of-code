Hi.

I decided to only post my #100DaysOfCode progress on Twitter as I found that to be more than enough. I am all about building projects now, so trying to invest most my time in that :)

Therefore, you can see my **#100DaysOfCode** updates on [my Twitter](https://twitter.com/larsparsfromage).

- Check out [the Official Site](http://100daysofcode.com/) for the #100DaysOfCode movement.
